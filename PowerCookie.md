and on clicking on `Continue as guest` it showed \

I first thought of something related to a hidden block in the HTML script but on glancing over the script it showed no exceptional elements \

I clicked on the `Continue as Guest` button changed the cookie value to `1` which gave me the flag `picoCTF{gr4d3_A_c00k13_0d351e23}`
